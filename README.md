Vulkan game engine/simulation engine project I wrote for fun. This will take a while to finish, I'm not being serious on this project.

## Build
### Linux
- Install dependencies
```bash
  make install
```
- Create a build directory
```bash
  mkdir build
  cd build
```
- Use cmake to Generate Makefile
```bash
  cmake -S .. -B . -G "Unix Makefiles"
```
- Build
```bash
  make
```
- Profit

### Windows
Coming Soon...

## Big Thanks
